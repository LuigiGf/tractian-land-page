# Tractian-Land-Page-Builded By LUIGIGF
This is Tractian's web developer frontend challenge project, developed entirely in NextJS.
In this challenge I would have to produce a complete landpage for Tractian, in this case I managed to develop something in a basic way, but showing results about experience using CSS, Next.js and other techs. I strongly recommend that you analyze not only the produced page but also the programming code itself.
